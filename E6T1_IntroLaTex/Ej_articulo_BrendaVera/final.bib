	abstract = {Formalin preservation, freezing, and salted and non-salted smoking are often used to preserve fishes. Body proportions of fish show changes upon preservation when applying different preserving techniques; most authors report a decrease in length and some authors report changes in weight and condition factor (k). Four groups of round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) were subjected to the above treatments. Initial fork length (cm) and weight (g) ranged from 8.7 to 10.8 cm and 6.74 to 11.4 g, respectively. All fish decreased in both length and weight, with highly significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences. Condition factor decreased in all treatments except formalin. Percentage reductions in length, weight, and condition factor were 11.0, 68.0 and 54.8\% with salted smoking; 13.0, 69.3 and 53.3\% with non-salted smoking; 3.0, 14.1 and 6.7\% with freezing; and 7.1, 13.3 and 108.1\% with formalin preservation, respectively. Shrinkage was the least with freezing, followed by formalin, salted smoking, and non-salted smoking preservation.},

	abstract = {In recent years, economic growth has produced a global change in the demand for food, fibre and energy supply. This has gone together with the globalisation of the agro-industrial production systems, leading to a qualitative change in land use because of intensive use of technological inputs. Uruguay, just as the other countries of the region, is part of this phenomenon. The massive introduction of forest crops has been made over native grassland ecosystems, replacing traditional productive activities of the post-colonial period. Research on eucalyptus afforestation shows depletion of the ecosystem services associated with grassland and loss of the resilience capacity of the system. Impacts on soil organic matter, soil physicochemical properties, the hydrological cycle and on biodiversity are analysed. This review (with emphasis on Uruguay and the River Plata Basin) tries to contribute to an integrated vision of the environmental consequences of current land-use change. 176 C.
